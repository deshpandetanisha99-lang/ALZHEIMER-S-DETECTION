1.Problem Statement
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder that leads to memory loss, cognitive decline, and loss of independence.  
Early detection is crucial but difficult due to subtle, overlapping symptoms.
The goal of this project is to use machine learning to predict dementia status (Demented vs. Non-Demented) based on longitudinal clinical data.  
This enables early intervention and supports doctors in decision-making.

2.Scope of the Project
Build an ML pipeline using structured patient data
Detect patterns associated with cognitive decline
Provide predictions on dementia likelihood
Assist in early screening—not replace clinical diagnosis
Train and evaluate a Random Forest model

Not included:
MRI image processing  
Real medical diagnosis  
Advanced deep learning models 

3.Target users
students and health institutions

4.High-Level Features
Import and clean longitudinal patient data  
Automatic categorical encoding  
Random Forest classification model  
Prediction of dementia status  
Metrics: accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report  
Modular code for easy future enhancement
